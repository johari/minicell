This project "extends the range of applications that can be tackled with spreadsheets", "without loss to usability and accessibility to non-experts."

Minicell provides first-class support for networks and graphs inside the spreadsheet environment.

It makes it easy for non-programmers to perform sophisticated graph modeling tasks,
including solving optimization problems such as shortest path problem or maximum flow.

It also eliminates typical pre-processing steps that are required to
reshape tabular data into a graph model.

We believe graph theory is an important mathematical tool,
and we believe we can make non-programmers more effective in
important (often critical) tasks by providing a natural and effective support
for graph modeling inside spreadsheets.
