-- Implementing these functions was a bit boring (or intimidating?)
-- I was not in a good mood when I implemented them. ðŸ¤•
-- Be careful with the rest of this source file.

-- I feel like my abstractions are only a thin layer over each other
-- and I'm just doing the manual labor of converting between them,
-- whereas a DSL could easily express "my intent"
-- (find "the best wrangler" with respect to demonstrations)
-- in a concise and clear way

-- Although the lines below implement my intent (hopefully),
-- they do not "reflect it".

-- Perhaps I need to find a better way to express my intent.
-- I need a collection of clear expressions that reflect my intent.

-- I got so many type errors here. More than this simple task required.
-- Not so happy about that. Here's an example:

--This argument is:

--    List VertexAndPerhapsCells

--But `fromList` needs the 1st argument to be:

--    List ( EExpr, List Cell )

-- However, I have

--    type alias VertexAndPerhapsCells = (EExpr, List Cell)

-- The type system is overwhelmed by the way I'm trying to go about solving this problem..

-- Oh man.. seems like this is actually a bug in the compiler..
